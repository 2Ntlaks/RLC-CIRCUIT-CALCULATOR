# RLC Circuit Calculator - Example Test Cases

## Test Case 1: Basic Series RLC Circuit
Input:
- Supply voltage: 12 V
- Frequency: 1000 Hz
- Resistance: 100 Ohms
- Inductance: 50 mH
- Capacitance: 10 μF

Expected Results:
- Xc ≈ 15.915 Ohms
- Xl ≈ 314.159 Ohms  
- Z ≈ 314.562 Ohms
- I ≈ 0.0381 A
- Circuit Type: Inductive (Xl > Xc)
- Phase Angle: ~71.46°

## Test Case 2: Resonant Circuit
Input:
- Supply voltage: 10 V
- Frequency: 225 Hz (near resonant frequency)
- Resistance: 50 Ohms
- Inductance: 50 mH
- Capacitance: 10 μF

Expected Results:

- Phase angle ≈ 0°
- Maximum current

## Test Case 3: Capacitive Circuit
Input:
- Supply voltage: 5 V
- Frequency: 100 Hz
- Resistance: 200 Ohms
- Inductance: 10 mH
- Capacitance: 100 μF

Expected Results:
- Xc > Xl (capacitive circuit)
- Current leads voltage
- Negative phase angle

## Test Case 4: High Frequency Circuit
Input:
- Supply voltage: 15 V
- Frequency: 10000 Hz
- Resistance: 75 Ohms
- Inductance: 5 mH
- Capacitance: 1 μF

Expected Results:
- High inductive reactance
- Very inductive circuit
- Large positive phase angle

## Common Circuit Analysis Points:
1. At resonance: Xl = Xc, Z = R (minimum), Phase = 0°
2. Inductive (Xl > Xc): Current lags, positive phase angle
3. Capacitive (Xc > Xl): Current leads, negative phase angle
4. Power factor = cos(phase angle)
5. Only resistor dissipates real power
