# RLC Circuit Calculator

This is a C program that calculates the various parameters of a series RLC circuit, including:

- Capacitive Reactance
- Inductive Reactance
- Impedance
- Current
- Voltage across Resistor, Capacitor, and Inductor
- Power
- Resonant Frequency

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc rlc_circuit.c -o rlc_circuit`).
2. Run the compiled program (`./rlc_circuit`).
3. Follow the prompts to enter the circuit parameters (voltage, frequency, resistor, inductor, and capacitor).
4. The program will display the calculated values in both textual and tabular formats.

## Dependencies

- `stdio.h`
- `stdlib.h`
- `windows.h`
- `math.h`
